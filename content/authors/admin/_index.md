  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a M.S. student at Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Kexin Rong](https://kexinrong.github.io/).

My research focuses on **developing video query systems for spatial-temporal events indexing and retreival**. Broadly, I am interested in **database, data infrastructure** and **large-scale distributed systems**. 

Before joining Georgia Tech, I worked 5+ years as a backend engineer at Coupang and LINE, where I contributed to build and scale services handling half-million transactions and serving hundreds of millions of users.
